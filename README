An example CCS project for the Hercules TMS570LC43x with autogenerated HALCoGen drivers and FreeRTOS.
All functional code is in /src/main.cc, with drivers and FreeRTOS in /lib/halcogen.

To recreate this project from scratch:
  - Create a new CCS Project
    * Set the Target to TMS570LC43xx
  - Create a new Target Configuration in the CCS project
    * Name it whatever you want
	* Alternatively, create the new configuration in a shared location
	* Set the Connection to Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug Probe
	* Select TMS570LC43xx in list of boards/devices
  - Create a new HALCoGen project inside of /lib/
    * Select the TMS570LC43x Family, then select the device with the _FREERTOS suffix
  - Configure the HALCoGen drivers
	* Under the "[device]_FREERTOS/Driver Enable" tab, disable all drivers except for GIO
  - Generate HALCoGen driver code with "File > Generate Code"
  - In CCS, add the generated /include/ directory to the project includes
 	* "Properties > C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols"
  - Disable the autogenerated HL_sys_main.c main file
    * In the case of the example, the code was wrapped with #ifdef/#endif with a macro that will never be defined
    * Code must be placed between the comments labelled USER CODE BEGIN/END (N), or it will be overwritten by HALCoGen if the code is ever regenerated.

Tada!
